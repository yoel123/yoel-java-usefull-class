this is a usefull class i use in alot of projects.

for now it has a shorthand for system.out.print . insted i use S.o to print to console.

thers also table method that can turn a 2d array to a a formated string table.
this also helped me in a few projects.

just copy the S class to your project and check main.java to see how its used
